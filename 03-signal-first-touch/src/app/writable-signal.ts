 * 1. Writable Signal
 * We can create writable signals using signal function, which takes an initial value
 * and returns a writable signal.
 * 
 * Writable signal is first and foremost a function, 
 * which you can call to extract its current value.
 * 
 * 2. Computed Signal  
 * Computed signal is a read-only signal you cannot modify them, they calculate themselves
 * and modify themselves based on an expression that may include other signals
 * 4.
 *
